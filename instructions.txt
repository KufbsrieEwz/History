Start the Game:
  1. Click the answer you think is correct on the trivia card!
  2. If you got it correct you will be able to roll the die (by clicking it) to move forward; otherwise you will forfeit your turn and the game will progress without you!
  3. Continue play until someone wins!
Tiles:
  1. Plains: Nothing! Just a normal / default tile.
  2. Forest: Due to difficult terrain, you will move 1 tile slower than normal if starting on this tile!
  3. Tundra: Due to harsh terrain, you will move 2 tiles slower than normal if starting on this tile!
  3. Water: You cannot stop on this tile, you must either cross the entire body of water in one go or not cross it at all!
